🎯 Bulls and Cows Game in C 🐮🐂
Welcome to the Bulls and Cows Game implemented in C! This project showcases a command-line version of the classic logic-based guessing game, designed to test and improve your deductive reasoning skills. Dive into the challenge of guessing a secret 4-digit number with unique digits, and refine your coding skills with efficient algorithms and thoughtful error handling.

🚀 Project Overview
The Bulls and Cows Game is a digit-based guessing game where players attempt to deduce a randomly generated secret number within a limited number of attempts. The program provides feedback in terms of "Bulls" (correct digits in the correct position) and "Cows" (correct digits in the wrong position), guiding the player towards the correct answer.

Key Features:
🧠 Logical Deduction: Sharpens problem-solving skills with every guess.
🔄 Unique Digit Validation: Ensures every number generated and guessed has unique digits, adding an extra layer of complexity.
📉 Efficient Performance: Implemented with optimized algorithms for input validation, comparison, and feedback delivery.
⌛ Time-bound Challenge: Players have a limited number of attempts to guess the secret, adding a thrilling element of pressure.
💡 Industrial Relevance
